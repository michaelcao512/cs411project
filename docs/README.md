# CS 411 Project Proposal :memo:

## 1. Social Media Based Movie/Show Recommendation :tv:
Is Netflix getting boring for you? Is it getting difficult finding interesting shows or movies that will actually get you hooked on the edge of your seats? Grab your popcorn and let this web application do the searching for you. 

Data about users is pulled from their social media (such as their Twitter feed, Instagram explore page, Reddit posts, etc) which users initially connect with using OAuth. This data along with the user profile is stored within the database and ran through the Watson sentiment analysis to determine what genre to recommend to the user. Based on this genre, a list of movies and/or shows will be returned to the user which will contain a rating and a short synopsis. This list will be garnered from a data set of movies and tv shows. Additional features such as a random recommendations, integration with public streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime for easier access to recommedations, and cinema showings around Boston may be implemented.
