- **MERN Stack**: The MERN Stack is a popular web development stack that consists of MongoDB (as the database), Express.js (as the backend), React.js (as the frontend), and Node.js (as the server-side runtime environment). 
  * The reason we chose the MERN stack is because of how widely utilized it is in the web development industry so we believe it would be an essential learning experience for all of us. The entire framework is also fullstack Javascript which will polish our skills in the language. 
  * The reason we chose MongoDB over a relational database such as MySQL is because of performance. The information stored in our database will not require any complex queries so it would be more efficient to use a non-relational database. 
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that allows for easier code maintenance and scalability. 
  * The reason we chose TypeScript is because we can catch bugs early in the development process and enjoy the benefits of better code organization and readability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of predefined classes that one can use to style your web application. 
  * The reason we chose Tailwind is because we easily and quickly create a responsive UI without writing too much custom CSS code. 
- **AWS**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud-based service that offers a variety of services such as server hosting, storage, and data processing. By using AWS, one can easily deploy oneâ€™s MERN stack web application to the cloud, making it accessible to users anywhere in the world. 
  * The reason we chose AWS is because we plan on hosting everything on the cloud with no need of a dedicated physical server. Since AWS is the most popular cloud-based server, we chose it over other cloud-based services like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform because it would bring us the most experience in the industry if we were to understand its use now.
